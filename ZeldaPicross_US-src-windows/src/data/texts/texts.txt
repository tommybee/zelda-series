Tutorial : After completing all the picross from a map, improve your total time to earn a reward.
Tutorial : Press Enter to solve the picross of the current box.
Tutorial : Use the direction arrows to move the cursor, use W (or Z) to check a box and X to mark it as empty. *The numbers show you how many succesive boxes need to be checked on each line and column. **Every mistake will make you lose life and if you run out of hearts you'll be unable to continue the picross.
Tutorial : Use the direction arrows to move from box to box.
Tutorial : Your time to solve the picross is limited. If you run out of time, you'll lose a heart and receive some additional time in return.
Tutorial : Trying to complete lines by elimination is a good strategy : fill in the cases you are sure off.
Tutorial : Don't forget to use X to mark the empty boxes, it will be a life saver.

The insane desire of Ganon for the Triforce changes the Kingdom into picross grids.
The weird curse changes the landscape, slicing the Kingdom in squares.
Faced with the squared land, Link storms out to defeat Ganon and to save his princess.
After the lengthy quest, the Hero of Hyrule again fulfilled his destiny. Link solved all the Picross, defeated Ganon, recovered the Triforce and saved the Princess. **The Realm, freed from the curse, returns to it original form and peace reigned again. **Meanwhile, our Hero hopes Ganon will return to bring back some life to the too peaceful Kingdom of Hyrule.
